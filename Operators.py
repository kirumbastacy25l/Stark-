# Arithmetic Operators
x = 40
y= 32
print(x + y)
print(x - y)
print(x * y)
print(x / y)
print(x % y)# Modulus - Returns remainder after division


# Comparison Operators
print(x < y)
print(x > y)
print(x <= y)
print(x >= y)
print(x == y)#Equal to
print(x != y)#Not equal to




#Assignment Operators
a = 10
print(a)
a +=2
print(a)

#logical operators - and,or,not

print(34<50 and 56 >200)
print(34<50 or 56 >200)

print(not(34<50 or 56 >200))
